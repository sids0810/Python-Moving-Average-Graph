# Mini Project 1: Stock Price and SMA Analyzer for a stock

## Description
This project demonstrates the fetching, analysis, and visualization of historical stock price data for the stock. It specifically calculates and plots the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) alongside the daily closing stock price to identify trends. This was completed as part of a learning exercise to practice data analysis skills in Python.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data manipulation and SMA calculation)
* yfinance (for fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance)
* Matplotlib (for plotting the data)
